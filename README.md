# MeFi Index Fund
The MeFi Index Fund is a decentralized and autonomously managed Defi Index fund. It allows clients to buy into the market as a whole without picking winners and losers. MeFi aims to be DeFi equivalent of the S&P 500 by using ChainLink price feeds and deterministic formulas to measure which coins to contain in the index.
